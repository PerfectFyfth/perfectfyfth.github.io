<p>i was originally planning to do some kind of collab with <a href="https://clwdytunes.carrd.co/">clwdy</a> for for <a href="https://artbyform.com/">Form</a> All Nighter Vol. 7, but after trying to come up with a thing for hours, we realised we couldn&rsquo;t really come up with much of anything, so we split off and did our own things.<br>
i spent hours after that attempting to come up with something to no avail, and with approximately 8 hours before the deadline, i was on the verge of completely giving up. but in the last four hours, i was set. i wasn&rsquo;t giving up. i was going to do something. so in about 3 hours, i threw this together. despite everything, i still managed to make something.<br>
despite all odds is that track, it didn&rsquo;t make it onto the compilation, so i self-released it.</p>

random note: i really like how the visuals turned out on the video, even if it&rsquo;s just a short looping animation</p>
