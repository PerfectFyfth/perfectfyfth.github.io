[{"content":"i was originally planning to do some kind of collab with clwdy for for Form All Nighter Vol. 7, but after trying to come up with a thing for hours, we realised we couldn\u0026rsquo;t really come up with much of anything, so we split off and did our own things.\ni spent hours after that attempting to come up with something to no avail, and with approximately 8 hours before the deadline, i was on the verge of completely giving up. but in the last four hours, i was set. i wasn\u0026rsquo;t giving up. i was going to do something. so in about 3 hours, i threw this together. despite everything, i still managed to make something.\ndespite all odds is that track, it didn\u0026rsquo;t make it onto the compilation, so i self-released it. you can listen to it here on bandcamp, soundcloud, youtube, and newgrounds   random note: i really like how the visuals turned out on the video, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just a short looping animation\n in case you\u0026rsquo;re interested, here\u0026rsquo;s a screenshot of the entire reaper project ","date":"2022-08-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://perfectfyfth.github.io/p/despite-all-odds/cover_huf6d75f1bf99b4a01243b248a92a8b1ad_143000_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://perfectfyfth.github.io/p/despite-all-odds/","title":"despite all odds"},{"content":"most of the stuff i use is free, unless stated otherwise. GRAPHICS   GNU IMAGE MANIPULATION PROGRAM (GIMP) - basically the free and open source alternative for Photoshop. the ui / ux is divisive, to say the least, but i\u0026rsquo;ve been using it almost exclusively for almost all of my graphics, and it definitely can do the job.\n  ASEPRITE - art program designed with pixel art in mind. has a great, intuitive interface.\n  BLENDER - THE program for anything 3D. i\u0026rsquo;m not sure what else to say about it. most of art / visuals done in blender.\n  TOUCHDESIGNER - a really powerful visual programming language. it can do a ton of things, and i recommend looking into it, but i mainly use it for live, audio-reactive visuals.\n  MUSIC/AUDIO DAW / STANDALONE PROGRAMS   REAPER - my main DAW since 2019, a bit of a learning curve for some, but lightweight, really flexible and customizable. us$60 for a personal license, but the free trial version lasts forever without any limitation.\n  bespoke synth - a really neat, completely free modular synth / DAW environment, really neat for sound design, and working with live.\n  SONOBUS - audio plugin or standalone program for sharing audio, great for collaboration.\n  VST PLUGINS Instruments  VITAL - you probably know about vital already, hands down the best free (and arguably non-free as well) software synthesizer. it does just about everything. HELM - earlier synth from the same creator as vital, not nearly as powerful, but simple, and has an interesting sound, especially with the modulation, feedback, and distortion. SPITFIRE AUDIO LABS - spitfire offers a lot of great free instrument sample libraries, i like a lot of their atmospheric sounds. MT - POWERDRUMKIT - a decent free drum kit. T-FORCE ALPHA PLUS - a little unstable from my testing, but a great synth for trance and anything that needs large supersaws and whatnot KEYZONE CLASSIC - just a basic piano plugin, i\u0026rsquo;m not sure what to say about this one.  Effects  AIRWINDOWS - a TON of small, lightweight, cpu efficient audio effects. they usually do one thing, but do it very well. TAL FREE PLUGINS - tal offers a really full, free reverb. i haven\u0026rsquo;t used many of their other plugins but they are pretty solid as well. KJAERHUS AUDIO CLASSIC PLUGINS - although they are old plugins from a long-defunct company, they are still really solid effects plugins, and especially their auto-filter. OTT - this thing is a meme at this point. an over-the-top multiband compression plugin, that that can crush any sound, that works for a lot of things, for better or for worse. ALLPASSPHASE - free and open source clone of the popular plugin from kilohearts, disperser. it has a really unique, immediately recognizable, bubbly, weird sound. this is achieved by abusing multiband artifacts, which i won\u0026rsquo;t get into detail now, but Inverted Silence has a great video on it TRANSPIRE - a solid free transient shaper plugin. not sure what to say about this one either.  resources for REAPER  REAPACK - package manager for REAPER. makes managing REAPER plugins and extensions much easier.  themes\n HYDRA theme - a good minimal REAPER theme. Default Commala 5 - the theme i use.  extensions\n GLOBAL SAMPLER a powerful tool for sound design, lets you record everything happening in your DAW.  JS plugins\n SAIKE TOOLS - a lot of good free JS plugins. GERAINT LUFF - same as above, but with somewhat more experimental plugins.  to use JS plugins outsude of REAPER, you can use a VST wrapper called YSFX MISC  YABRIDGE - Wine VST bridge, allows you to run Windows VST plugins on Linux.
