&lt;h2 id=&#34;whoa&#34;&gt;whoa.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s been over three years since i started releasing music as perfectfyfth, and a lot has changed over that time. i&amp;rsquo;d like to thank everyone who has been with me since the beginning, as well as everyone who has come along the way, it has been amazing and i have no plans on stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thank you all, take care, and keep your eye out ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i was going to write more, but i&amp;rsquo;m not really sure what to say lol&lt;/p&gt;
